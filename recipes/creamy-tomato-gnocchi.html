        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion chopped finely</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li> 1 tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>3-4 cloves garlic minced</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp dashes Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 (14 fluid oz) can dices tomatoes with juices</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy/whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 lb uncooked potato gnocchi</li>
            <li>1 small handful fresh basil torn or chopped</li>
            <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly grated parmesan cheese (optional) to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Add the olive oil to a skillet on medium-high heat. Saut√© the onion for about 5 minutes (ok if it's lightly browned).</li>
           <li>Add the white wine, Dijon mustard, garlic, and Italian seasoning. Stir until you've got a smooth mixture and let it cook for about a minute.</li>
           <li>Add the diced tomatoes, cream, and gnocchi. Wait until it starts to lightly bubble again, then reduce the heat to medium and cover for 5 minutes.</li>
           <li>Give it a good stir, and add the basil and season with salt & pepper. Let it cook for another couple minutes to ensure the gnocchi is fully cooked and the starch thickens the sauce up a bit more.</li>
           <li>Stir in parmesan (optional) or sprinkle it on top. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <li>
            <ul>The gnocchi will cook right in the sauce - no need to cook it beforehand. 
            </ul>
            <ul>This makes 4 reasonably sized portions. If you're feeding extra hungry people, I recommend serving this with a salad, garlic bread, and/or something else. It would also make a great side dish.
            </ul>
        </li>
