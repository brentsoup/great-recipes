        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="centertext">While it may initially seem like a bit of a basic cooking technique, knowing how to cut an apple into slices can save you quite a bit of time!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A cutting knife</li>
            <li>1 apple of your choice</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>Place apple on a cutting board with the stem facing up.  Using a sharp knife, make a cut about ½-inch to the right or left of the stem and cut all of the way down, paying close attention to avoid the core. (step 1 above)</li>
            <li>Turn the apple 90 degrees and make a similar cut all of the way through the apple.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process until you have four pieces of apple and a separate piece of core.</li>
            <li>Place the apple pieces cut side down on the cutting board and slice into ¼-½ inch pieces.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately! Cut apple slices are best when served immediately since they will begin to brown quickly when exposed to oxygen.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>TIP: How to keep cut apples from browning</h3>
        <div class="smaller"><p>Add apple slices to a large bowl and toss with freshly squeezed lemon juice.</p>
        <p>You’ll need about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice for every half pound of apple slices.</p>  
        <p>The lemon juice will prevent the apple from browning and oxidizing because it is full of citric acid.  This lower pH liquid creates a barrier between the apple and the air and allows the oxygen to react with it first before coming into contact with the apples’ surfaces.</p>
        <p>Sprinkling a bit of citric acid powder will also produce similar results.

        </p>
        <p>Apple slices that have been tossed in lemon juice will stay fresh for up to 2-3 days when stored in the refrigerator.

        </p>
        <p>An alternative method you can try is submerging the apple slices in a bowl of water.  Since water is covering the apples’ surfaces, it will not come into contact with the air and will slow down the browning process.
