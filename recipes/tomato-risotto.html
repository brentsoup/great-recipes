        <h2>Description</h2>
        <div class="centertext"><p>The following excerpt is from the book <em>Gordon Ramsay's Home Cooking: Everything You Need to Know</em>:</p>
        <p>"The secret to making a good risotto is to add your
            hot stock very gradually, stirring to make sure it has
            all been absorbed before adding the next ladleful.
            This way you can control the consistency better and
            make sure the rice still has a slight bite to it-al
            dente, as the Italians call it-when you take it off
            the heat. This classic risotto just needs a garnish of
            arugula or baby spinach."</p></div>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup risotto rice</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken or vegetable stock</li>
            <li>3 1/2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>8 oz cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>1/3 cup mascarpone cheese</li>
            <li>1 oz Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
            <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan, add the rice, and
            stir well to coat the grains in the oil. Bring the stock
                to a boil and add 1 ladleful of it at a time to the rice,
                stirring well after each addition, until the liquid has
                been absorbed and the rice is cooked but still al dente.
                (This will take about 15-18 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the butter in a small saucepan,
                add the tomatoes, and gently cook for about 10
                minutes until soft. Pass through a mouli or coarse
                sieve; alternatively, mash with a potato masher.</li>
            <li>When the rice is'cooked, fold in the mascarpone,
                Parmesan, and the tomato mixture, adjust the
                seasoning, and <strong>serve.</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p class="smaller">To remove the need for last-minute stirring, you can serve risotto as a cake. Make the risotto in advance, taking it slightly beyond the al dente stage (about 20 minutes), then add the mascarpone, Parmesan, and tomato. Spread the mixture out in a square pan lined with wax paper, cover, and chill for 2-4 hours. When ready to serve, heat 3 1/2 Tbsp butter in a large frying pan. Cut the risotto cake into 4 squares and quickly pan fry for about 3 minutes on each side until golden, taking care when you flip them over. Serve immediately.</p>
